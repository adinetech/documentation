DAppNode is a simple FOSS platform for deploying and hosting DApps, P2P clients and blockchain nodes. A censorship-resistant tool built to help bringing the
decentralized world everyone wants for themselves, their friends and family. For the user, DAppNode takes the shape of a platform, hosted in a machine that
this person owns, that allows them to deploy Decentralized Apps and Blockchain Nodes in their own machine and access them directly via a decentralized protocol
without using any centralized gateways or gatekeepers.

You can either install the **DAppNode** software on your own compatible hardware or use the DAppNode box to get easy and unrestricted access to Web3 and P2P economies. There are dozens of different DApps available via the DAppStore (now including Mysterium!) so you can earn crypto by running your node and participating in the maintenance, validation, or resource sharing of these decentralized networks.
