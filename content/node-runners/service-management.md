## My node is not displayed in Mobile or Desktop apps

If your node is not available in our consumer apps, you should make sure that the configuration is correct:

- Your node quality is too low (switch quality slider from Medium+ to Any to view it)
- Your node is outdated. Read our [update guide](/node-runners/setup/updating/).
